# Contribution
You can help grow this list! Just create a simple issue to
request a fetch (possibly yours) to be on this list.

The only requirements are fairly easy and clear instructions on the
README, and to function properly (if not specific to an OS)
Or you can choose to PR it.

You can also choose to add previews to fetches that don't have them.
